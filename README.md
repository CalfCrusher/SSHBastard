# SSHBastard
**A tool to scan CIDR range, searching SSH servers and try to bruteforce them using wordlists**

## Disclaimer

This is a tool that i made for learning python purpose only. Nowadays bruteforcing SSH is does not make sense at all to me. We're not in '98 and password are not 'password' or '12345' but more complex. Also if you think that on entire internet will be a couple of misconfigured ssh server don't loose your time. Keep studying and coding. Bruteforcing is always last resort.
