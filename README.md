# SSHBastard
**This tool scan CIDR range to search SSH servers, then try to bruteforce using wordlists**

## Disclaimer

This is a tool that i made for learning python purpose only. Nowadays bruteforcing SSH is does not make sense at all to me. We're not in '98 and password are not 'password' or '12345' but more complex. Also if you think that on entire internet will be a couple of misconfigured ssh server don't loose your time, Bruteforcing is always last resort.

It makes much more sense using this tool as **ssh-honeypot finder**!
