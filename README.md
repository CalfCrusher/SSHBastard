# SSHBastard
**This tool scan CIDR range to search SSH servers, then try to bruteforce them using wordlists**

## Disclaimer

This is a tool that i made for learning python purpose only. Nowadays bruteforcing SSH is does not make sense at all to me. We're not in '98 and password are not 'password' or '12345' but more complex. Also if you think that on entire internet will be a couple of misconfigured ssh server don't be a looser, bruteforce is always last resort and is not elegant. It makes much more sense using this tool as **ssh-honeypot finder**!
